<p1>To me, the biggest draw to music is that you can create it using whatever sounds interest you the most. Usually for me, I imagine the guitars and drums when I create something.I will also write some lyrics based on ideas of different concepts that come in my head. Although not all of the ideas that pop into my head I use, it at least lets the creativity flow.For example, one of the newest song ideas I have is creating a song with the beat based in morse code, and the guitar based in binary.</p1>

<p2>Usually these ideas will flow to me when I am just playing the guitar, and listening to some of my musical inspirations I have. I will usually just stick with the ideas that evoke some sort of feeling, or the stuff I find that sounds the coolest. The hardest part of the songs for me is to match the music with the lyrics.This process can take some time, but I enjoy the creating aspect of it, and it takes my mind off of regular tasks, like school work and such.</p2>
