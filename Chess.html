<h1>Chess</h1>

<p1> 
I started playing sports when I was around 11-12 years old. My first experience with extra curricular activities was when I started playing chess when I was in first grade.
Most of my friends played chess around that time as well, so it was easy to get into.

 I started getting more competitive with chess when I was around 11-12. Many of the chess tournaments I went to were local tournaments, and state tournaments. 
In this year, I won a couple of tournaments, including the K-8 State Individual Championship for the State of Maine. Before this point, the best I had ever done in a tournament was second place.
Playing for Deer Isle's chess team, I was able to travel to different states to compete in the national chess tournaments. These tournaments were fun because most of my friends would go to these tournaments as well. 
I was also able to compete in chess tournaments for a cash prize as well, and I have won over $200. 
After high school, I had some experience coaching chess as well, and helped the elementary school win a championship. Because of this, I was able to travel with the team to compete in the National Tournament in Louisville, Kentucky.
