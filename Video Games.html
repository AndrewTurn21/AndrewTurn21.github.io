<h1>VIDEO GAMES</h1>

<p>I started playing video games when I was around 8-9 years old. I started off by playing Gameboy games, as it was the first console I ever owned. 
When I was in middle school, I got my first console of a Playstation 2. With the Playstation 2, I was able to get into different kinds of video games, such as racing games, or platformers.

<p> Sometime two years ago, I finally upgraded to a Playstation 3. I simply found myself enjoying many of the games that the Playstation offered. With this newer console, I started getting into newer games.
One of the games I have found myself enjoying is the Bioshock series. Many of these games have a really in depth story, and the atmosphere of these games really make them enjoyable. 
My favorite of the Bioshock games is Bioshock Infinite. This game felt different than many of the other games that I played, and I found myself truly interested in all of the details of this game. 
Someday, if I have enough time and resources, I hope to be able to make my own video game. The game would just be all the aspects I enjoy out of video games. While I don't currently have any ideas, I am sure I would be able to develop one when the time comes.
