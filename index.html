<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Andrew Turner. I am currently a senior studying accounting. One of the biggest things I am interested in is playing music. I have played music since I was a young kid, and I continue to play music to this day.</p>

<p> Another thing that interests me is video games. I have played video games for a very long time. I tend to enjoy video games that bring back the feeling of nostalgia, or that intrigue me with story. Mostly, I tend to play console games, but if I had a higher quality computer, I would be tempted to play PC games.</p>

<p> Finally, I really enjoy playing chess. Although I have not played chess competitively since high school, I have always enjoyed playing it. </p>
