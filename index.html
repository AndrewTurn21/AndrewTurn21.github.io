<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p1>Hello, my name is Andrew Turner. I am currently a senior studying accounting. One of the biggest things I am interested in is playing music.
I have played music since I was a young kid, and I continue to play music to this day.</p>

<p> Another thing that interests me is video games. I have played video games for a very long time. 
I tend to enjoy video games that bring back the feeling of nostalgia, or that intrigue me with story. 
Mostly, I tend to play console games, but if I had a higher quality computer, I would be tempted to play PC games.I have posted this link to some of my favorite video games </p>

<p> Finally, I really enjoy playing chess. Although I have not played chess competitively since high school, I have always enjoyed playing it. Here is a link to more of my chess experience.
